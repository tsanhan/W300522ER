## A. Go Over:

1. [DOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KShnPYN-voI)
2. [DOM Events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF1_MlZ5l6M)
3. go over the class recording
4. go over our solutions of the homework file (hw1.js)
5. go over the class exercise (DOMManipulation.js)
6. go over the class exercise (hw-dom-man.js)
7. go over the class exercise (bubbling.js)


## B. Practice:
1. 
   * create a todo list using DOM manipulation and events
   * create a simple input tag and a button next to it.
   * on every button click a new todo task will be added to the list (ul)
     * also the input is cleared from any current text
   * the ul list will will contain li elements wi a button at the side (can be a real button or a span with a text or emoji)
   * when the button next to the li element is clicked the li element will be removed from the list (or be crossed using text-decoration: line-through ( or what ever you want to symbol the the task is done))
   also when the button si clicked: choice:
       1. make the button text change to "undo" and when clicked again the task will be un-done
       2. make the button disabled to prevent the user from clicking it again 
  

2. 
   * use the images from swapi (the visual guid):
     * use the array: ["Luke Skywalker", "C-3PO" "Darth Vader", "Leia Organa", "Owen Lars", "Beru Whitesun lars", "R5-D4", "Biggs Darklighter", "Obi-Wan Kenobi"]
     * list the array in a lis in a ul
     * on every hover of each li create a an element with the photo of the character
       * the photos are in https://starwars-visualguide.com/assets/img/characters/[the index in the array + 1].jpg
       * the photo should be seen only when hovering over the name, once the hover is done the photo should disappear
